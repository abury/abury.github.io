          <p>
            I love seeing how software can empower people, and for the last 11 years I’ve brought the worlds of Engineering and Business together to design and build great software products.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a developer I’ve worked across the stack in Ruby, Node, React, React Native, CI/CD, I’ve built traditional monolithic servers, native mobile clients and serverless.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a Founder and Tech Lead I’ve hired and worked with amazing teams to design, build and scale systems for startups, small business and enterprise. I utilise Extreme programming to write clean, sustainable code that ultimately translates into a product that not only provides value and joy to it’s users, but can also evolve as the businesses needs inevitably change.

                    Aron’s ability to speak at a deeply technical level with client IT resources is valuable in moving through complex and ambiguous technical environments, however he is also able to consistently translate this language for non-technical clients, explaining things in a common-sense manner that gives him a strong level of versatility.

                    Aron joined the company early on, during a period of significant growth, and swiftly implemented tools and processes which vastly improved the consistency and efficiency with which the Engineering team were able to work. <br /><br /> His ability to rapidly scope and plan work resulted in a clear, shareable Engineering deliverables and timeframes, improving communication with non-Engineering team members and resulting in a better service overall to CoinJar's users. Outages and downtime became all but obsolete under Aron's lead.

                  <p>
                    Within a handful of weeks the team had turned around. Aron assisted in the hiring of new developers and was hands on in every aspect of the dev team that needed assistance. His breadth of knowledge and no-BS let's get it done attitude kept everyone including myself focussed and in check. <br /><br />We quickly developed a larger dev team and became a well oiled machine understanding where time and energy was being wasted and how to minimise it and keep on task.

                    As a leader Aron has made me question my approach to programming as well as work life and has truly been an inspiration to strive for excellence. He is constantly reviewing best practises ensuring that the mobile team’s output is both quality and efficient. Some examples of this include TDD and continuous integration, both been introduced under his guidance.
